# House Price Prediction EDA and Modeling
This repository contains the code and data for conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a house price dataset and building a predictive model using advanced techniques in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

# Overview

#The main objectives of this project are:

- Perform EDA to understand the characteristics of the dataset and extract valuable insights for house price prediction.
- Utilize Python libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for efficient data preprocessing and visualization.
- Employ machine learning models, such as Lasso Regression from the Scikit-learn library, for predictive analysis.
- Implemented feature selection using SelectFromModel from Scikit-learn to identify the most important features for prediction.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a Kaggle Derived Dataset which consists of various features related to house prices. The dataset is derived from two csv files:
- test.csv
- train.csv

# Results
The EDA reveals several insights into the factors influencing house prices, such as the relationship between house size and price, the impact of location on prices, etc. Additionally, the Lasso Regression model and SelectFromModel libraries achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting house prices based on the available features.

# Conclusion
Through this project, we have demonstrated the importance of thorough exploratory data analysis in understanding datasets and extracting valuable insights. Furthermore, by employing machine learning techniques, we can build predictive models to estimate house prices with reasonable accuracy.
